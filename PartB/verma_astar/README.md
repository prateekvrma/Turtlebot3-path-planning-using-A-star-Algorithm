# ENPM661: Project 2
# Implementation of Dijkstra algorithm for a point robot. 

Github Link: https://github.com/prateekvrma/Dijkstra-PathPlanning-PointRobot.git

## Dependencies
Python 3.7
Numpy      (For numerical computation)
Math       (For Mathematical Operations)
OpenCV     (For Visualization)

## Steps for Execution
1. Clone the folder from the git repository: https://github.com/prateekvrma/Dijkstra-PathPlanning-PointRobot.git
2. Go to the folder location in the terminal.
3. Run the python file with the following command :

 python "filename".py 

 Here: "filename" -- should be the name of python file

Example Command:

~$ python3 Dijkstra-pathplanning-prateek-verma.py

4. Next enter values for start (x,y) and goal (x,y) positions and wait for the code to execute.

Example Inputs:

Enter start x: 10

Enter start y: 200

Enter goal x: 330

Enter goal y: 20


5. At last you will see the output: "Goal Reached!!" along with Cost to Come value for the goal position.


## Results
The output video generated as: "dijkstra_out.mp4"
